			<p>My name is <strong>Musthafa Thamyeez</strong> and I am trying to make</p>
			<p id="in180">180 websites in 180 days</p>
			<p>I was inspired by <a href='https://zube.io/blog/how-i-built-180-websites-in-180-days-and-became-a-yc-fellowship-founder/'>Jennifer Dewalt and her story about how she created 180 websites in 180 days!</a> It inspired me so much that I am going to give that a try and see how far I can go.</p>
			<p>You can follow the project here and on the blog</p>
